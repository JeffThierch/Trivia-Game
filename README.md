# Trivia Game

The idea of this project, is that in a group, we should create a trivia-style game, where the user can choose the difficulty and the topics of the questions, and to win he must get as many questions right.

The game has a rank system, so the user can compete with his friends to see who can get the better score.

We used ReactJS along with Redux and Hooks to distribute data and control the application's life cycle.
